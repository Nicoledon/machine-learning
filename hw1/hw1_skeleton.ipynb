        "Dear class, here are some tips to follow in coding HWs in this class, to minimize the chances of hitting hard-to-resolve bugs:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Do not set/alter random seeds.**\n",
        "2.   Most bugs come down to minor errors in your code. The hardest and most important part of coding is debugging; debugging ML code is a key skillset you should acquire in this class.\n",
        "3.   Good python coding avoids loops if at all possible: in particular, **for any vector and matrix operations, use `numpy` functions instead of loops**. This will often speed up your code by orders of magnitude. You may also want to take a look at the [python primer](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis5190/fall2025/docs/basics_python_numpy.ipynb).\n",
        "4.   Pay **extra attention to \"copying\" vs \"moving\" objects** i.e. take care during assignment operations. Otherwise, it may lead to incorrect results or Out Of Memory issues and Colab notebook restarts.\n",
        "5.   If you are running into a `'__builtins__'` error, it's likely because you're using a function call of the form `numpy.ndarray.mean()`, like `a.mean()`. This is technically correct, but our autograding software PennGrader can't handle it. Please use the function **call `numpy.mean(a)` instead.**\n",
        "6.   For this homework especially, pay **special attention to** the `compute_gradient` function and the `fit` function of the **Linear regression** section as these involve multiple key concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Have fun coding up and training your first ML algorithms!\n"
